Usage Instructions: 

Import Data: Start by importing the road accident data into Power BI using the appropriate data source connectors.

Data Cleaning: Utilize the Power Query Editor in Power BI to clean the data, handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring high-quality data.

Data Processing: Apply data processing techniques to transform the data as required for analysis, such as aggregating, filtering, or creating calculated columns.

Data Modelling: Implement data modeling using Power BI's data modeling capabilities to structure and optimize the data for analysis.

Background Design: Enhance the aesthetics of the dashboard by designing visually appealing backgrounds in PowerPoint and importing them into Power BI.

Data Visualization and Dashboard Build: Create interactive and informative data visualizations, such as charts, maps, and tables, to showcase the insights derived from the road accident data. Build a dynamic dashboard that allows stakeholders to explore the data interactively.

Interactive Features: Implement interactive features like action filters and slicers to enable users to drill down into the data and filter the information based on specific criteria.

Export/ Publish: Once the dashboard is complete, export or publish it in a format suitable for sharing with stakeholders or embedding in other platforms.
